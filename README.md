# rydeu-frontend-task (Completion Date 28-Apr-2020)
Build a trip planner prototype, which provides an interface to plan a customized trip

Feature:
1. The page will have a "Create Transfer" button and a main section where the transfers will be added day wise.
2. Clicking on Create transfer should open a modal with below input fields
    * Pickup location & Drop location (suggestion should be shown through Google API)
    * Date and time of travel
    * first name
    * Last name
    * Vehicle type and count (Should be a dropdown with multiple vehicle options)
    * no. of passengers & baggage count
    * Save button will save the event in the main section with the filled details visible in the page.
3. A user can add multiple transfer events and they should be assembled in the page as per the date and time.
4. There should be an option to edit and delete an already added event.


Project Expectation - 
1. The project should be built using React
2. Use Google Api for suggestion and selection of pickup/drop locations.
3. do not use any CSS framework (bootstrap, semantic etc). SCSS can be used.
4. The design should be mobile responsive
5. Brownie points for using Redux
